## Introduction

### Why

 - The set of applications in the Kubernetes cluster is potentially large and complex;
 - Manually inspecting and administering them, and keeping different environments (e.g. production, acceptance) in sync is laborious and difficult;
 - Cooperating with multiple tenants in this shared cluster increases the complexity.
